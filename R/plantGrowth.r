#' Aboveground biomass of imaginary seedlings treated with two levels of N and P in a crossed design.
#'
#' A sample (fake) dataset showing aboveground biomass of six seedlings per treatment:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'   \item N Nitrogen level in watering solution (L = 0.1 g/L; H = 1g/L)
#'   \item P Phosphorus level in watering solution (L = 0.04; H = 0.4 g/L)
#'   \item seedSource Blocking factor (Maternal seed source in open pollinated system).
#'   \item drymass Dry aboveground biomass of each seedling after x weeks.
